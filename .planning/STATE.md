# Project State: Duct Tape

**Last updated:** 2026-05-16
**Mode:** Yolo (fast iteration, validation through shipping)

## Project Reference

**Core Value**: When a job ignites, a production manager can instantly see who's available, what gear is free, and assign resources from one place

**Current Focus**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Multi-Tenancy) — executing Plan 2

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Job Management) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

### Phase Context

Goal: Job lifecycle management with CRUD operations, state transitions, and resource assignment foundation

Next action: Execute Plan 02-03 (Job state transition validation endpoint)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity**: N/A (no phases completed)
**Quality**: N/A (no verifications run)
**Coverage**: 43/43 v1 requirements mapped to phases ✓

### Phase Completion History

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files | Completed |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 01    | P01  | 170s     | 4     | 15    | 2026-05-16 |
| 01    | P02  | 369s     | 6     | 13    | 2026-05-16 |
| 01    | P03  | 230s     | 4     | 10    | 2026-05-16 |
| 02    | P01  | 227s     | 3     | 6     | 2026-05-16 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Date | Rationale |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| 8-phase roadmap derived from requirements | Roadmap | 2026-05-15 | Natural delivery boundaries: Foundation → Jobs → Resources → Calendar → Coordination → Notifications → Portal → Polish |
| Messaging + Tasks + Files grouped as single phase | Roadmap | 2026-05-15 | Must ship together for stickiness; users won't adopt partial coordination tools |
| PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenancy | Phase 1 | 2026-05-15 | Cannot be retrofitted later; must be correct from day one |
| TIMESTAMPTZ for all datetime columns | Phase 1 | 2026-05-15 | Timezone handling cannot be added later without migration |
| Database-level conflict detection | Phase 3 | 2026-05-15 | Prevents double-booking race conditions; application-layer insufficient |
| Used bcrypt directly instead of passlib | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | passlib 1.7.4 incompatible with modern bcrypt; direct usage simpler |
| SET LOCAL for tenant context | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | Transaction-scoped prevents context leaks between requests |
| httpOnly cookies for tokens | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | More secure than headers, prevents XSS token theft |
| Placeholder sections in JobResponse | Phase 2 P01 | 2026-05-16 | UI can render empty state now, avoids breaking changes when Phase 3/5 add relationships |
| Manual migration creation | Phase 2 P01 | 2026-05-16 | Docker unavailable, followed Phase 1 pattern of code review validation |
| ILIKE for search instead of PostgreSQL full-text search | Phase 2 P02 | 2026-05-16 | Simpler implementation, sufficient for < 10K rows, can upgrade to ts_vector if needed |
| State field excluded from PATCH endpoint | Phase 2 P02 | 2026-05-16 | Dedicated transition endpoint in Plan 02-03 provides validation |
| Enum-based state machine vs transitions library | Phase 2 P03 | 2026-05-16 | 4-state linear flow too simple for transitions library overhead; enum more maintainable |

### Open Questions

- None yet (planning not started)

### Active Todos

- [ ] Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1 planning
- [ ] Review Phase 1 success criteria before planning
- [ ] Consider if Phase 3 needs research-phase for conflict detection algorithms

### Known Blockers

(none)

### Technical Debt

(none yet)

### Lessons Learned

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-15T22:10:44.303Z
**Stopped at:** Completed 02-03-PLAN.md

**What changed this session:**

- Executed Plan 02-02: Job CRUD API endpoints
- Created 5 REST endpoints (POST, GET list, GET single, PATCH, DELETE)
- Implemented search across title/description/venue using ILIKE
- Implemented filtering by state, venue, date range
- All endpoints use RLS tenant context (get_current_tenant dependency)
- Write endpoints (create/update/delete) require admin role
- Made 3 atomic commits (TDD: failing tests + implementation + router registration)
- PostgreSQL unavailable: tests written but not executed, deferred verification

**Context for next session:**

- Job CRUD API complete with search/filter capabilities
- Next: Plan 02-03 (Job state transition validation endpoint)
- Tests ready to run once PostgreSQL available (12 test functions in test_jobs_crud.py)
- State transitions currently unvalidated - Plan 02-03 will add validation logic
