# Project State: Duct Tape

**Last updated:** 2026-05-16
**Mode:** Yolo (fast iteration, validation through shipping)

## Project Reference

**Core Value**: When a job ignites, a production manager can instantly see who's available, what gear is free, and assign resources from one place

**Current Focus**: Phase 1 (Foundation & Multi-Tenancy) — executing Plan 2

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Job Management) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

### Phase Context

Goal: Job lifecycle management with CRUD operations, state transitions, and resource assignment foundation

Next action: Execute Plan 02-02 (Job CRUD API endpoints with state transitions)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity**: N/A (no phases completed)
**Quality**: N/A (no verifications run)
**Coverage**: 43/43 v1 requirements mapped to phases ✓

### Phase Completion History

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files | Completed |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 01    | P01  | 170s     | 4     | 15    | 2026-05-16 |
| 01    | P02  | 369s     | 6     | 13    | 2026-05-16 |
| 01    | P03  | 230s     | 4     | 10    | 2026-05-16 |
| 02    | P01  | 227s     | 3     | 6     | 2026-05-16 |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Date | Rationale |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| 8-phase roadmap derived from requirements | Roadmap | 2026-05-15 | Natural delivery boundaries: Foundation → Jobs → Resources → Calendar → Coordination → Notifications → Portal → Polish |
| Messaging + Tasks + Files grouped as single phase | Roadmap | 2026-05-15 | Must ship together for stickiness; users won't adopt partial coordination tools |
| PostgreSQL RLS for multi-tenancy | Phase 1 | 2026-05-15 | Cannot be retrofitted later; must be correct from day one |
| TIMESTAMPTZ for all datetime columns | Phase 1 | 2026-05-15 | Timezone handling cannot be added later without migration |
| Database-level conflict detection | Phase 3 | 2026-05-15 | Prevents double-booking race conditions; application-layer insufficient |
| Used bcrypt directly instead of passlib | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | passlib 1.7.4 incompatible with modern bcrypt; direct usage simpler |
| SET LOCAL for tenant context | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | Transaction-scoped prevents context leaks between requests |
| httpOnly cookies for tokens | Phase 1 P02 | 2026-05-16 | More secure than headers, prevents XSS token theft |
| Placeholder sections in JobResponse | Phase 2 P01 | 2026-05-16 | UI can render empty state now, avoids breaking changes when Phase 3/5 add relationships |
| Manual migration creation | Phase 2 P01 | 2026-05-16 | Docker unavailable, followed Phase 1 pattern of code review validation |

### Open Questions

- None yet (planning not started)

### Active Todos

- [ ] Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to begin Phase 1 planning
- [ ] Review Phase 1 success criteria before planning
- [ ] Consider if Phase 3 needs research-phase for conflict detection algorithms

### Known Blockers

(none)

### Technical Debt

(none yet)

### Lessons Learned

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-16T02:02:06Z
**Stopped at:** Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

**What changed this session:**

- Executed Plan 02-01: Job model and schemas foundation
- Created Job model with JobState enum (intake/simmer/active/complete)
- Created Pydantic schemas (JobCreate, JobUpdate, JobResponse) with placeholder sections
- Created database migration with performance indexes (state, scheduled_start)
- Made 4 atomic commits (TDD: failing tests + implementation + schemas + migration)
- Docker unavailable: followed Phase 1 pattern (manual implementation, deferred verification)

**Context for next session:**

- Job model and schemas complete, ready for API endpoints
- Next: Plan 02-02 (Job CRUD API with state transitions)
- Placeholder sections in JobResponse ready for Phase 3/5 relationships
- Migration 003 ready to apply once Docker available
